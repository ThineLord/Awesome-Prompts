## Prompt Example

**Description**: This prompt is for generating a close-up photograph of a business card designed to look like a code editor interface.

**Prompt**:
> A close-up shot of a hand holding a rectangular business card designed to look like a {file_format} file open in {code_editor}. The card shows code formatted in {syntax_type} with keys like {key1}, {key2}, {key3}, and {key4}.

Background is slightly blurred, keeping the focus on the card.

**Placeholder Examples**:

- {key1}: "name": BYGEN
- {key2}: "title": Gen AI Aficionado
- {key3}: "email": info@bygen-ai.com
