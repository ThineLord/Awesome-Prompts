## Prompt Example

**Description**: This prompt is for generating an ultra-realistic top-down photograph of a 3D-printed diorama.

**Prompt**:
> An ultra-realistic top-down photograph of a 3D-printed diorama inside a beige cardboard box, with the lid being held open by two human hands. The interior of the box reveals a miniature landscape of [COUNTRY NAME], featuring iconic landmarks, terrain, buildings, rivers, vegetation, and crowds of tiny, detailed human figures. The diorama is filled with vibrant, geographically appropriate elements, all crafted in a tactile, toy-like style using matte 3D-printed textures with visible layer lines. At the top, the inside of the box lid displays the phrase "[COUNTRY NAME]" in large, colorful, raised plastic letters—each letter in a different bright color. The lighting is warm and cinematic, highlighting the textures and shadows to evoke a sense of realism and charm, as if the viewer is opening a magical miniature version of the nation.

**Notes**: 
- Replace [COUNTRY NAME] with the desired country
- Perfect for creating educational content, travel guides, or cultural showcases
- The prompt emphasizes both realism and charm in the presentation
