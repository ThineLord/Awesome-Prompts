## Prompt Example

**Description**: This prompt is for generating a dynamic video that combines LEGO world visuals with AI-generated sound effects.

**Prompt**:
> A dynamic camera glides through a miniature LEGO world, where an epic adventure unfolds. All sound effects—footsteps, explosions, cars, dragons—are created using mouth sounds by a single AI-generated voice artist.
> 
> As each sound is made, the visuals instantly respond: LEGO characters jump into action, cars race, spaceships take off, volcanoes erupt. The journey moves through LEGO-built environments—city streets, underwater ruins, space stations, and lava lairs.
> 
> The video is fast-paced, playful, and visually rich, like a blend between The LEGO Movie and next-gen AI storytelling. The sound-to-visual sync creates a magical, toy-driven universe where imagination controls reality.

**Key Elements**:
- Dynamic camera movement through LEGO world
- AI-generated voice artist creating all sound effects

- Multiple LEGO environments
- Fast-paced and playful narrative style

**Notes**: 
- Perfect for creating engaging, family-friendly content
